Terraform is not available via pip because it's not a Python package; it's a standalone binary distributed by HashiCorp. Therefore, you can't install Terraform using pip. Instead, you need to download the Terraform binary and install it manually.

Here's how you can do it in a Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use a base image with necessary dependencies
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install AWS CLI using pip
RUN pip install awscli

# Install Terraform
RUN apt update && apt install -y wget unzip \
    && wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.0.11/terraform_1.0.11_linux_amd64.zip \
    && unzip terraform_1.0.11_linux_amd64.zip \
    && mv terraform /usr/local/bin \
    && rm terraform_1.0.11_linux_amd64.zip

# Verify Terraform installation
RUN terraform --version

# Define entry point command
CMD ["terraform init"]
